# Predicting-Hospital-length-of-Stay
This project aims to analyze medical data to predict the length of stay (LOS) of patients in a hospital. Various machine learning models are trained and evaluated to predict the LOS based on demographic and medical information.

Requirements:
Python (version 3.x)
Pandas (version 1.x)
Seaborn (version 0.11.x)
Matplotlib (version 3.x)
Scikit-learn (version 0.24.x)
XGBoost (version 1.x)

Data: The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named mimic3d.csv. It contains demographic and medical information of patients, including their LOS. You can also access the dataset from this url (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drscarlat/mimic3d)

Reproducing Results: The results can be easily reproduced just by executing each cell from the python notebook named final_project.ipynb which has all the details related to data preprocessing, analysis, and results step by step. If any package installation is required it can simply be installed by 'pip' command. For e.g. pip install xgboost.
